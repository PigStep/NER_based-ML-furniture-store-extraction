<p>Moo is a full scale wall–mounted Norwegian moose head light. Moo may be used for both indoor and outdoor decoration. The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp.</p>
<p>The inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns. The designers hope Moo will stand out as a post–modern kitch trophy, making the viewer smile happily as they recognize this “King of the Norwegian forest”. </p>

Care InstructionsRegular care is essential to the longevity of your rug. Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It’s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it’s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.

The Timber
Wood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased.
